== Player Team Page ==
- Mockups/wireframe

== Next things == 
- Player page when it's not your pick
- Figure out end of draft
- Timed tasks
- Sign in page

== Bugs ==
- prevent double requesting start
- prevent double making picks

Things that need to happen before draft
- Production ENV vars for mailgun, domain email address?
- Need to update tokens occasionally

Small things to do later
- draft controller should be plural
- Start new draft path skips validation/sets up admin user
- New player name should have focus after adding
- validation messages on new draft and add players
- Be smart about emailing the peoples with two picks in a row

== World of Ideas ==
