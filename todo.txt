== Player Team Page ==
x Mockups/wireframe
x Design
x Show pick made page
  x Handle back to back picks
  - Handle, you made your last pick (nil pick bug)
- Show current pick status
  
== Next things == 
- Player page when it's not your pick
- Figure out end of draft
- Autopick list
- Timed tasks
- Sign in page
- Better desktop design

== Bugs ==
- prevent double requesting start
- prevent double making picks

Things that need to happen before draft
- Production ENV vars for mailgun, domain email address?
- Need to update tokens occasionally

Small things to do later
- draft controller should be plural
- Start new draft path skips validation/sets up admin user
- New player name should have focus after adding
- validation messages on new draft and add players
- Be smart about emailing the peoples with two picks in a row
- Logs/performance analysis
- GA?  Something else?
- Flash errors (for trying to draft a drafted team)
- Seems like we're passing tokens around a lot.  Once you're authenticated
  we should trust that (and do authorization checks against picks).

== World of Ideas ==
Auto pick list.  Easy way to add teams, move them ^ up and down v
Should also display upcoming picks and what your next pick is.
Bunch up autopick emails
Pick page/your picks table should maybe show you're upcoming picks
